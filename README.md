# Knooght

"Game" using [Gosu](https://www.libgosu.org) to practice [POODR](http://www.poodr.com/) learnings.

Not that much to see here :) perhaps it evolves into an actually fun game, but it's not the objective.

## Setting up

```
brew update
brew install sdl2 libogg libvorbis
gem install gosu
```

## Running

```
cd app && ./main.rb
```

## Controls

k - Left player attack
j - Right player attack

That's it for now!
